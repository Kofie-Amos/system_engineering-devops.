This project introduces learners to input and output redirections and essential text-processing commands in Linux. Through hands-on tasks, students will gain practical experience in redirecting command output, reading from files, and using common filters like cat, head, tail, sort, and uniq. By the end of this project, learners will be able to control where output goes, manage errors, and combine commands with pipes for efficient data processing.
